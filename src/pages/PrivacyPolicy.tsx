          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Information You Provide To Us</h3>
          
          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Account Information:</h4>

            Some information is required to create an account to use ATIUM services, which includes your first and 
            last name, email address, contact address and contact telephone numbers (if relevant). Therefore, we will 
            ask you to provide some personal information, including your email address and name (you do not have to 
            use your full name, but you may if you wish). This account will be password protected and you will use 
            your email address to access your account. You can add other information to your account profile such as 
            your location, gender, height, weight, date of birth, and the activities you participate in (e.g. football, 
            running, jumping etc.). This information will be used for monitoring your performance and to provide 
            insights and benchmarks about your activities (durations, distances, etc.).

          <p className="mb-4">

          <p className="mb-8">
            We collect usage data when you use our Services. This includes information about your interaction with 
            our Services, for example when you view content, install applications, create an account, pair your 
            device or interact with your device via the application. We also collect cookie information and IP 
            address information about the device or computer you use to access our Services. This will only be 
            used for analysis purposes.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your 
            personal information in the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you, for instance to fulfill your order for our products and provide our sports tracking and stats service.</li>
            <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
            <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-4">
            We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests).</li>
            <li>Where it is needed in the public interest.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-4">
            We need your personal information primarily to allow us to perform our contract with you to provide our 
            goods and services and to enable us to comply with legal obligations. In some cases we may use your 
            personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own or those of third parties, provided your 
            interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. The situations in which we will process 
            your personal information are listed below:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Administering the contract we have entered into with you.</li>
            <li>To provide, improve and develop our Services.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you.</li>
            <li>To promote safety and security</li>
            <li>To prevent fraud.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our 
            use of your personal information. If you fail to provide personal information or If you fail to provide 
            certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with 
            you (such as fulfilling your order or providing our service).
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Change of purpose</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably 
            consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. 
            If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain 
            the legal basis which allows us to do so.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8">
            Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance 
            with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We will share your personal information with third parties if and where required by law, where it is

            it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, reporting requirements. To determine the 
            appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the 
            personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the 
            purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other
